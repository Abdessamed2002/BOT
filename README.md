**Effortlessly Manage Tasks with Your Own Telegram Bot**

The Goal is to Add a new task on the ToDoApp and the bot reply it to all telegram users, We try to benefite from the telegram API to use it in biggest Projects

So how it works here,
1) a telegram bot is created.
2) the bot api is lunched (it means this bot.js script).
3) some users start using the bot (when typing '/start').
4) whenever a new task be added in the principale APP, the app send a POST request to the endpoint api of the bot and from it our bot send this task to all the users.



**Ready to try it?**
Follow these simple steps to set up your own bot:

1) create you're own bot and get the token from the botFather

2) set up you're envirenment and pull the bot.js code and install :
npm install express
npm install body-parser
npm install cors
npm install node-telegram-bot-api

4) run the bot on you're terminal : node bot.js

5) start chating with you're bot and have fun :)

6) you can also use our ToDoApp to try the full experience. We insure you to get really interested with it trust us, you can get the full code from this link : (https://github.com/Abdessamed2002/ToDoApp)

pearhapse in this app the purpose is samll, just send tasks from the app to all the users of the bot, but in a real big project it will be a **boommm** 
**think of it**, a bot who can chat with hundreds and thousands of telegram users to avoide a lot of work and time and money on how to make chat and all his functionnalities for you're project you will never need to send text from you're app it's all automatition just do you're work when you finish the bot will send notifications to all users, moderators, and channels for groups.
