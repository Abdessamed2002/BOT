**Effortlessly Manage Tasks with Your Own Telegram Bot**

The Goal is to Add a new task on the ToDoApp and the bot reply it to all telegram users, We try to benefite from the telegram API to use it in biggest Projects

So how it works here,
1) a telegram bot is created.
2) the bot api is lunched (it means this bot.js script).
3) some users start using the bot (when typing '/start').
4) whenever a new task be added in the principale APP, the app send a POST request to the endpoint api of the bot and from it our bot send this task to all the users.



**Ready to try it?**

4) run the bot on you're terminal : node bot.js

5) start chating with you're bot and have fun :)

While this app's current purpose is limited to sending tasks from the app to users, its true potential lies in larger projects. **Imagine** a bot seamlessly interacting with hundreds or thousands of Telegram users, saving you countless hours and resources. Forget about manually crafting chat functionalities â€“ this bot automates it all. Focus on your core development, and let the bot handle user notifications across individual users, moderators, and even group channels. It's truly automation at its finest!
